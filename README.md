After exploring and analyzing the data, please:
Recommend a Driver's Lifetime Value (i.e., the value of a driver to Uber over the entire projected lifetime of a driver).
Please answer the following questions:
What are the main factors that affect a driver's lifetime value?
What is the average projected lifetime of a driver? That is, once a driver is onboarded, how long do they typically continue driving with Uber?
Do all drivers act alike? Are there specific segments of drivers that generate more value for Uber than the average driver?
What actionable recommendations are there for the business?
Prepare and submit a write up of your findings for consumption by a cross-functional audience.

You can make the following assumptions about the Uber rate card:
Base Fare $2.00
Cost per Mile $1.15
Cost per Minute $0.22
Service Fee $1.75
Minimum Fare $5.00
Maximum Fare $400.00
